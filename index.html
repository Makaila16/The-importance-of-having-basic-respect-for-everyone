    <h1> Changes </h1>
    <p> Some ways we can make changes is by trying to get rid of this display of this type of behavior from the media. We can bring more kind of respectful, peaceful and kind things
      to the media and display that more so that way thats the type of things people look up to instead of just being unnecessarily rude and forgetting how to actually act. 
      We can start with this change in schools as well and teach lessons on respect and how we can/should be respectful to our peers no matter what even if that peer did wrong you, 
      but if thats the case we can also teach how to forgive and forget more often. </p>
