    <h1> Affects </h1>
    <p> The affects of people not having basic respect may be people losing their self esteem or being afriad to use their voice for certain things because people have gotten so 
      comfrotable with being rude about every little thing. A lot of people fail to realize how just doing the bare minimum when it comes to respect can really change the way a 
      person feels about basically anything and make their day better. If people start seeing how you may only respect certain people and turn around and disrespect them when they 
      did nothing wrong they may feel aas though theres something wrong with them and might develop that type of mindset to start treating other people the same way. </p>
