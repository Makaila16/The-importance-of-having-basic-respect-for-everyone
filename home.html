    <h1> All about respect </h1>
    <p> Lack of respect lately has been increasing and becoming more and more normalized as the day goes by and it's starting to have an affect on socitey in general.
      We don't only see this lack of respect in the media but also in real life when doing our basic day to day things like for example going grocery shopping or just going out with
      our friends to the mall etc. People fail to realize how having basic respect can honestly take you a long way in life because people may start to respect you when they realize
      or see how you respect them, treat people how you'd like to be treated.</p>
